    The user fields are used to describe user information as part of the event.

    All fields in user can have one or multiple entries. If a user has more
    then one id, an array with the ids must be provided.
  fields:
    - name: id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        One or multiple unique identifiers of the user.
    - name: name
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Name of the user.

        As the field is a keyword, the field will not be tokenized.
    - name: email
      type: keyword
      phase: 1
      description: >
        User email address.
    - name: hash
      type: keyword
      phase: 1
      description: >
        Unique user hash to correlate information for a user in anonymized form.

        This is useful in case `user.id` or `user.name` cannot be used because
        it contains confidential information.
