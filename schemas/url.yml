- name: url
  title: URL
  description: >
    A complete URL, with scheme, host, and path.

    The URL object can be reused in other prefixes like `host.url.*` for
    example. It is important that whenever URL is used that the same structure
    is used.

    `url.href` is a [multi field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/multi-fields.html#_multi_fields_with_multiple_analyzers)
    which means the data is stored as keyword `url.href` and test
    `url.href.analyzed`. The advantage of this is that for running a query
    against only a part of the url still works without having to split up the
    URL in all its part on ingest time.

    Based on whatwg URL definition: https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/337
  fields:
    - name: href
      type: keyword
      description: >
        href contains the full url. The field is stored as keyword.

        `href` is an analyzed field so the parsed information can be accessed
        through `href.analyzed` in queries.
      multi_fields:
        - name: analyzed
          type: text
      example: https://elastic.co:443/search?q=elasticsearch#top
    - name: protocol
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The protocol of the request, e.g. "https:".
    - name: hostname
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The hostname of the request, e.g. "example.com".

        For correlation the this field can be copied into the `host.name`
        field.
    - name: port
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The port of the request, e.g. 443.
    - name: pathname
      type: text
      description: >
        The path of the request, e.g. "/search".
      multi_fields:
        - name: raw
          type: keyword
          description: >
            The url path. This is a non-analyzed field that is useful
            for aggregations.
    - name: search
      type: text
      description: >
        The search describes the query string of the request,
        e.g. "q=elasticsearch".
      multi_fields:
        - name: raw
          type: keyword
          description: >
            The url search part. This is a non-analyzed field that is useful
            for aggregations.
    - name: hash
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The hash of the request URL, e.g. "top".
    - name: username
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The username of the request.
    - name: password
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The password of the request.
    - name: extension
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The url extension field contains the extension of the file associated with
        the url.

        A simple example is `http://localhost/logo.png` where the extension would be `png`.
        There can also be more complex cases like `http://localhost/content?asset=logo.png&token=XYZ`
        where the extension could also be `png` but depends on the implementation.

        The `extension` field should be left out if the extension is not defined.
      example: png
