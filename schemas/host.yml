    All fields related to a host. A host can be a physical machine, a virtual
    machine, and also a Docker container.

    Normally the host information is related to the machine on which the event
    was generated / collected but also can be used differently if needed.

        Number of seconds relative to UTC. In case the offset is -01:30 the
        value will be -5400.

        host.name is the hostname of the host.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name or also a name specified by the user. It is
        up to the sender to decide which value to use.

        Unique host id.

        As hostname is not always unique, this often can be configured by the
        user. An example here is the current usage of `beat.name`.

        For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`.
        Or it vm, container for example or something user defined.
