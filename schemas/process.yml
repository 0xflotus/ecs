    These fields contain information about a process.

    If metrics information is collected for a process and a process id / name
    shows up in a log message, these fields should help to correlated the two.
    It is expected that the `process.pid` will often also stay in the metric
    itself and only copied to the global field for correlation.
  fields:
    - name: args
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Process arguments.

        May be filtered to protect sensitive information.
      example: ["-l", "user", "10.0.0.16"]
    - name: name
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Process name.

        This is sometimes also known as program name or similar.
      example: ssh
    - name: pid
      type: long
      description: >
        Process id.
      exmple: ssh
    - name: ppid
      type: long
      description: >
        Process parent id.

    - name: title
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Process title.
