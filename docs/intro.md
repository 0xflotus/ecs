# Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) is used to provide a common data model when
ingesting data into Elasticsearch. Having a common schema allows you correlate
data from sources like logs and metrics or IT operations
analytics and security analytics.

ECS is still under development and backward compatibility is not guaranteed. Any
feedback on the general structure, missing fields, or existing fields is appreciated.
For contributions please read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The current version of ECS is `0.1.0`.
